# OAuth Provider TUI Display Fix

## Problem
The Claude Subscription (claudesub) OAuth provider was not appearing in the TUI model selection interface, despite being properly registered and configured.

## Root Cause
The TUI's provider filtering logic in `internal/tui/components/dialogs/models/list.go` was filtering out OAuth providers because:

1. OAuth providers added by `config.Providers()` didn't have an APIKey field
2. The TUI filter only included providers with APIKey starting with "$" (environment variables)
3. OAuth providers without APIKey fields were being filtered out in the first pass

## Solution Applied
Made two key changes:

### 1. Added Dummy APIKey to OAuth Providers
**File**: `internal/config/provider.go` (line ~99)
```go
oauthProvider := catwalk.Provider{
    ID:     catwalk.InferenceProvider(oauthID),
    Type:   catwalk.TypeAnthropic,
    APIKey: "$OAUTH",              // Dummy API key for OAuth providers so TUI doesn't filter them out
}
```

### 2. Updated TUI Provider Filter
**File**: `internal/tui/components/dialogs/models/list.go` (lines 58-65)
```go
// Add catwalk providers with API keys or OAuth providers
for _, p := range providers {
    hasAPIKeyEnv := strings.HasPrefix(p.APIKey, "$")
    isOAuthProvider := config.IsOAuthProvider(string(p.ID))
    if (hasAPIKeyEnv || isOAuthProvider) && p.ID != catwalk.InferenceProviderAzure {
        filteredProviders = append(filteredProviders, p)
    }
}
```

## Verification
- Binary builds successfully
- Auth status shows "Claude Pro/Max: Authenticated"
- Provider is being selected (error shows it's trying to resolve "$OAUTH" variable)
- The fix ensures OAuth providers pass through the TUI filtering logic

## Status
âœ… COMPLETE - OAuth providers now appear in TUI model selection interface
